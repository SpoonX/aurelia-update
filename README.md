# Archived

It was fun while it lasted, but we have to stop maintaining these repositories. We haven't used these projects for quite some time and maintaining them is becoming harder to do.

You deserve better, and for that reason we've decided to archive some repositories, which includes this one.

Feel free to fork and alter the repositories, and go forth making awesome stuff.

# Aurelia-update
A super simple command line tool that updates your aurelia dependencies.

1. Install aurelia: `npm install aurelia-update -g`.
2. Simply call `aurelia-update` on the command line.

## Note
If you're using aurelia-cli, perhaps take a look at this document: http://aurelia.io/hub.html#/doc/article/aurelia/framework/latest/the-aurelia-cli/16
